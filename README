GenreFixer attempts to correct the genre of your music files. The genre are gathered
from the Last.FM API (no user account necessary) tags and then written into the
‘Grouping’ field of your music file(s) in iTunes. The genre will be selected by
choosing the highest rated tag that can be linked to a set of common tags.

Usage:
Select some tracks in iTunes, then run 'ruby imgt.rb' to launch. Configure as you like,
then click Get Tags!
